This page contains a conceptual overview of how concurrent programming works in
Dart. It explains the event-loop, async language features, and isolates from
a high-level. For more practical code examples of using concurrency in Dart,
read the Asynchronous programming page and
Isolates page.
Concurrent programming in Dart refers to both asynchronous APIs, like
Future
and
Stream
, and isolates, which allow you to move processes to separate
cores.
All Dart code runs in isolates, starting in the default main isolate,
and optionally expanding to whatever subsequent isolates you
explicitly create. When you spawn a new isolate,
it has its own isolated memory, and its own event loop.
The event loop is what makes asynchronous and
concurrent programming possible in Dart.
Event Loop
#
Dart’s runtime model is based on an event loop.
The event loop is responsible for executing your program's code,
collecting and processing events, and more.
As your application runs, all events are added to a queue,
called the event queue.
Events can be anything from requests to repaint the UI,
to user taps and keystrokes, to I/O from the disk.
Because your app can’t predict what order events will happen,
the event loop processes events in the order they're queued, one at a time.
The way the event loop functions resembles this code:
dart
while (eventQueue.waitForEvent()) {
eventQueue.processNextEvent();
}
content_copy
This example event loop is synchronous and runs on a single thread.
However, most Dart applications need to do more than one thing at a time.
For example, a client application might need to execute an HTTP request,
while also listening for a user to tap a button.
To handle this, Dart offers many async APIs,
like Futures, Streams, and async-await.
These APIs are built around this event loop.
For example, consider making a network request:
dart
http.get('https://example.com').then((response) {
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
print('Success!');
}
}
content_copy
When this code reaches the event loop, it immediately calls the
first clause,
http.get
, and returns a
Future
.
It also tells the event loop to hold onto the callback in the
then()
clause
until the HTTP request resolves. When that happens, it should
execute that callback, passing the result of the request as an argument.
This same model is generally how the event loop handles all other
asynchronous events in Dart, such as
Stream
objects.
Asynchronous programming
#
This section summarizes the different types and syntaxes of asynchronous programming in Dart.
If you're already familiar with
Future
,
Stream
, and async-await,
then you can skip ahead to the isolates section.
Futures
#
A
Future
represents the result of an asynchronous operation that will
eventually complete with a value or an error.
In this sample code, the return type of
Future<String>
represents a
promise to eventually provide a
String
value (or error).
dart
Future<String> _readFileAsync(String filename) {
final file = File(filename);
​
// .readAsString() returns a Future.
// .then() registers a callback to be executed when `readAsString` resolves.
return file.readAsString().then((contents) {
return contents.trim();
});
}
content_copy
The async-await syntax
#
The
async
and
await
keywords provide a declarative way to define
asynchronous functions and use their results.
Here's an example of some synchronous code
that blocks while waiting for file I/O:
dart
const String filename = 'with_keys.json';
​
void main() {
// Read some data.
final fileData = _readFileSync();
final jsonData = jsonDecode(fileData);
​
// Use that data.
print('Number of JSON keys: ${jsonData.length}');
}
​
String _readFileSync() {
final file = File(filename);
final contents = file.readAsStringSync();
return contents.trim();
}
content_copy
Here's similar code, but with changes (highlighted) to make it asynchronous:
dart
const String filename = 'with_keys.json';
​
void main() async {
// Read some data.
final fileData = await _readFileAsync();
final jsonData = jsonDecode(fileData);
​
// Use that data.
print('Number of JSON keys: ${jsonData.length}');
}
​
Future<String> _readFileAsync() async {
final file = File(filename);
final contents = await file.readAsString();
return contents.trim();
}
content_copy
The
main()
function uses the
await
keyword in front of
_readFileAsync()
to let other Dart code (such as event handlers) use the CPU while native code
(file I/O) executes. Using
await
also has the effect of converting
the
Future<String>
returned by
_readFileAsync()
into a
String
. As a
result, the
contents
variable has the implicit type
String
.
infoNote
The
await
keyword works only in functions that have
async
before the
function body.
As the following figure shows, the Dart code pauses while
readAsString()
executes non-Dart code, in either the Dart runtime or the operating system.
Once
readAsString()
returns a value, Dart code execution resumes.
Streams
#
Dart also supports asynchronous code in the form of streams. Streams
provide values in the future and repeatedly over time. A promise to provide a
series of
int
values over time has the type
Stream<int>
.
In the following example, the stream created with
Stream.periodic
repeatedly emits a new
int
value every second.
dart
Stream<int> stream = Stream.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (i) => i * i);
content_copy
await-for and yield
#
Await-for is a type of for loop that executes each subsequent iteration of the
loop as new values are provided. In other words, it’s used to “loop over”
streams. In this example, a new value will be emitted from the function
sumStream
as new values are emitted from the stream that’s provided as an
argument. The
yield
keyword is used rather than
return
in functions that
return streams of values.
dart
Stream<int> sumStream(Stream<int> stream) async* {
var sum = 0;
await for (final value in stream) {
yield sum += value;
}
}

Isolates
#
Dart supports concurrency via isolates, in addition to asynchronous APIs.
Most modern devices have multi-core
CPUs. To take advantage of multiple cores, developers sometimes use
shared-memory threads running concurrently. However, shared-state concurrency is
error prone
and can
lead to complicated code.
Instead of threads, all Dart code runs inside isolates.
Using isolates, your Dart code can perform multiple independent tasks at once,
using additional processor cores if they're available.
Isolates are like threads or processes, but each isolate has its own memory
and a single thread running an event loop.
Each isolate has its own global fields,
ensuring that none of the state in an isolate is accessible
from any other isolate. Isolates can only communicate to each other via message
passing. No shared state between isolates means concurrency complexities like
mutexes or locks
and data races
won't occur in Dart. That said, isolates don't prevent race conditions all
together. For more information on this concurrency model, read about
the Actor model.
info
Platform note
Only the Dart Native platform implements isolates.
To learn more about the Dart Web platform,
see the Concurrency on the web section.
The main isolate
#
In most cases, you don't need to think about isolates at all. Dart programs run
in the main isolate by default. It’s the thread where a program starts to run
and execute, as shown in the following figure:
Even single-isolate programs can execute smoothly. Before continuing to the next
line of code, these apps use async-await
to wait for asynchronous operations to
complete. A well-behaved app starts quickly, getting to the event loop as soon
as possible. The app then responds to each queued event promptly, using
asynchronous operations as necessary.
The isolate life cycle
#
As the following figure shows,
every isolate starts by running some Dart code,
such as the
main()
function.
This Dart code might register some event listeners—to
respond to user input or file I/O, for example.
When the isolate's initial function returns,
the isolate stays around if it needs to handle events.
After handling the events, the isolate exits.
Event handling
#
In a client app, the main isolate's event queue might contain repaint requests
and notifications of tap and other UI events. For example, the following figure
shows a repaint event, followed by a tap event, followed by two repaint events.
The event loop takes events from the queue in first in, first out order.
Event handling happens on the main isolate after
main()
exits. In the
following figure, after
main()
exits, the main isolate handles the first
repaint event. After that, the main isolate handles the tap event, followed by a
repaint event.
If a synchronous operation takes too much processing time, the app can become
unresponsive. In the following figure, the tap-handling code takes too long, so
subsequent events are handled too late. The app might appear to freeze, and any
animation it performs might be jerky.
In client apps, the result of a too-lengthy synchronous operation is often
janky (non-smooth) UI animation. Worse, the UI might become completely
unresponsive.
Background workers
#
If your app's UI becomes unresponsive due to a time-consuming
computation—parsing a large JSON file, for example—consider offloading
that computation to a worker isolate, often called a background worker.
A common case, shown in the following figure, is spawning a simple worker
isolate that performs a computation and then exits. The worker isolate returns
its result in a message when it exits.
A worker isolate can perform I/O
(reading and writing files, for example), set timers, and more. It has its own
memory and doesn't share any state with the main isolate. The worker isolate can
block without affecting other isolates.
Using isolates
#
There are two ways to work with isolates in Dart, depending on the use-case:
Use
Isolate.run()
to perform a single computation on a separate thread.
Use
Isolate.spawn()
to create an isolate that will handle multiple
messages over time, or a background worker. For more information on working
with long-lived isolates, read the Isolates page.
In most cases,
Isolate.run
is the recommended
API to run processes in the background.
Isolate.run()
#
The static
Isolate.run()
method requires one argument: a callback that will be
run on the newly spawned isolate.
dart
int slowFib(int n) => n <= 1 ? 1 : slowFib(n - 1) + slowFib(n - 2);
​
// Compute without blocking current isolate.
void fib40() async {
var result = await Isolate.run(() => slowFib(40));
print('Fib(40) = $result');
}
content_copy
Performance and isolate groups
#
When an isolate calls
Isolate.spawn()
, the two isolates have the same
executable code and are in the same isolate group. Isolate groups enable
performance optimizations such as sharing code; a new isolate immediately runs
the code owned by the isolate group. Also,
Isolate.exit()
works only when the
isolates are in the same isolate group.
In some special cases, you might need to use
Isolate.spawnUri()
, which
sets up the new isolate with a copy of the code that's at the specified URI.
However,
spawnUri()
is much slower than
spawn()
, and the new isolate isn't
in its spawner's isolate group. Another performance consequence is that message
passing is slower when isolates are in different groups.
Limitations of isolates
#
Isolates aren't threads
#
If you’re coming to Dart from a language with multithreading, it’d be reasonable
to expect isolates to behave like threads, but that isn’t the case. Each isolate
has its own state, ensuring that none of the state in an isolate is
accessible from any other isolate. Therefore, isolates are limited by their
access to their own memory.
For example, if you have an application with a
global mutable variable, that variable will be a separate
variable in your spawned isolate. If you mutate that variable in the spawned
isolate, it will remain untouched in the main isolate. This is how isolates are
meant to function, and it's important to keep in mind when you’re considering
using isolates.
Message types
#
Messages sent via
SendPort
can be almost any type of Dart object, but there are a few exceptions:
Objects with native resources, such as
Socket
.
ReceivePort
DynamicLibrary
Finalizable
Finalizer
NativeFinalizer
Pointer
UserTag
Instances of classes that are marked with
@pragma('vm:isolate-unsendable')
Apart from those exceptions, any object can be sent.
Check out the
SendPort.send
documentation for more information.
Note that
Isolate.spawn()
and
Isolate.exit()
abstract over
SendPort
objects, so they're subject to the same limitations.
Synchronous blocking communication between isolates
#
There is a limit to the number of isolates that can run in parallel.
This limit doesn't affect the standard asynchronous communication between isolates
via messages in Dart. You can have hundreds of isolates running concurrently
and making progress. The isolates are scheduled on the CPU in round-robin fashion,
and yield to each other often.
Isolates can only communicate synchronously outside of pure Dart,
using C code via FFI to do so.
Attempting synchronous communication between isolates
by synchronous blocking in FFI calls
may result in deadlock if the number of isolates is over the limit,
unless special care is taken.
The limit is not hardcoded to a particular number,
it's calculated based on the Dart VM heap size available to the Dart application.
To avoid this situation, the C code performing synchronous blocking
needs to leave the current isolate before performing the blocking operation
and re-enter it before returning to Dart from the FFI call.

Dart_EnterIsolate
and
Dart_ExitIsolate
to learn more.
Concurrency on the web
#
All Dart apps can use
async-await
,
Future
, and
Stream
for non-blocking, interleaved computations. The Dart web platform, however,
does not support isolates. Dart web apps can use web workers
to run scripts
in background threads similar to isolates. Web workers' functionality and
capabilities differ somewhat from isolates, though.
For instance, when web workers send data between threads, they copy the data
back and forth. Data copying can be very slow, though, especially for large
messages. Isolates do the same, but also provide APIs that can more efficiently
transfer
the memory that holds the message instead.
Creating web workers and isolates also differs. You can only create web workers
by declaring a separate program entrypoint and compiling it separately. Starting
a web worker is similar to using
Isolate.spawnUri
to start an isolate. You can
also start an isolate with
Isolate.spawn
, which requires fewer resources
because it
reuses some of the same code and data
as the spawning isolate. Web workers don't have an equivalent API.
