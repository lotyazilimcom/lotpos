infoNote
As of the 3.27 release, Impeller is the default
rendering engine for both iOS and Android API 29+.

What is Impeller?
#
Impeller provides a new rendering runtime for Flutter.
Impeller precompiles a smaller, simpler set of shaders
at engine-build time so they don't compile at runtime.
For a video introduction to Impeller, check out the following
talk from Google I/O 2023.
Watch on YouTube in a new tab: "Introducing Impeller, Flutter's new rendering engine"
Impeller has the following objectives:
Predictable performance:
Impeller compiles all shaders and reflection offline at build time.
It builds all pipeline state objects upfront.
The engine controls caching and caches explicitly.
Instrumentable:
Impeller tags and labels all graphics resources,
such as textures and buffers.
It can capture and persist animations to disk without affecting
per-frame rendering performance.
Portable:
Flutter doesn't tie Impeller to a specific client-rendering API.
You can author shaders once and convert them to backend-specific
formats, as necessary.
Leverages modern graphics APIs:
Impeller uses, but doesn't depend on, features available in
modern APIs like Metal and Vulkan.
Leverages concurrency:
Impeller can distribute single-frame workloads across multiple
threads, if necessary.

Where can you use Impeller? For detailed info, check out
the Can I use Impeller? page.
iOS
#
Since Flutter 3.29, Impeller is the
default on iOS with no ability to
switch to Skia.
Android
#
Impeller is available and enabled by default on Android API 29+.
On devices running lower versions of Android or don't support Vulkan,
Impeller falls back to the the legacy OpenGL renderer.
No action on your part is necessary for this fallback behavior.
To disable Impeller when debugging,
pass
--no-enable-impeller
to the
flutter run
command.
flutter run --no-enable-impeller
content_copy
To disable Impeller when deploying your app,
add the following setting to your project's
AndroidManifest.xml
file under the
<application>
tag:
xml
<meta-data
android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.EnableImpeller"
android:value="false" />
content_copy
Web
#
Flutter on the web offers two renderers --
canvaskit
and
skwasm
-- which both currently use Skia.
They might use Impeller in the future.
macOS
#
You can try out Impeller for macOS behind a flag.
In a future release, the ability to opt-out of
using Impeller will be removed.
To enable Impeller on macOS when debugging,
pass
--enable-impeller
to the
flutter run
command.
flutter run --enable-impeller
content_copy
To enable Impeller on macOS when deploying your app,
add the following tags under the top-level
<dict>
tag in your app's
Info.plist
file.
xml
<key>FLTEnableImpeller</key>
<true />
